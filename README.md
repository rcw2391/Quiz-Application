# Quiz-Application
Created with Django. Create a quiz, take a quiz. Edit a quiz. View your results, view the results of everyone who has taken your quiz!

A user has a dashboard where they can view the quizzes they have created or taken.

In the dashboard, a user can select a quiz they have taken to view their scores, and from there view individual submissions.

A user can also select a quiz they created to make any changes. A question in a quiz can be completely altered, or even deleted. 

You can also delete quizzes you have created.
